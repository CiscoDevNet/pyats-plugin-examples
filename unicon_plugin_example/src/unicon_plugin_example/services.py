Unicon Plugin Service
---------------------

Each method under a Unicon connection is modelled as a "service". Services must
inherit from the BaseService class, and implement call_service() method, which
acts as the entrypoint to when a service is called.

After services are defined, they should be aggregated together under a 
ServiceList class as attributes.
