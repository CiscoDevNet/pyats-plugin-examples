Connection Statements
---------------------

Automation is all about automatically performing actions without human 
intervention. This includes automatically answering to dialog prompts by 
programmatically replying to each dialog prompt.

Statements are the building blocks of dialog handling logic within Unicon.
Typically Unicon plugins have a statements.py file where all statements 
particular to this platform is located.
